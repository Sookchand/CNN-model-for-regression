#  CNN model Regression House Price
This is a solution to the Iowa Extended Housing Prices problem using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The dataset consists of 1460 samples with 8 features and a label (SalePrice). The data is first split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 7:3. Then, the training data is standardized and transformed into an image format with a shape of 1x8x1x1. The CNN model is then constructed with a LeNet-5 structure and trained with some hyperparameters. Finally, the model is used to predict the testing set and the results are visualized.
## Acknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge the creators of Keras and TensorFlow for providing the tools to create this solution.
